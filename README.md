Welcome to our BayesFlow library for efficient simulation-based Bayesian workflows! Our library enables users to create specialized neural networks for *amortized Bayesian inference*, which repay users with rapid statistical inference after a potentially longer simulation-based training phase.

> 🚨 **Attention, new users!** 🚨
> This is the `master` branch of BayesFlow, which only supports TensorFlow. The `dev` branch contains the new BayesFlow version 2.0 that fully builds on Keras 3. This means you can choose your backend (PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow) and have full flexibility. We are actively working on this new BayesFlow version and will merge it into the `master` branch once all features are implemented.

## Conceptual Overview

A cornerstone idea of amortized Bayesian inference is to employ generative
neural networks for parameter estimation, model comparison, and model validation
when working with intractable simulators whose behavior as a whole is too
complex to be described analytically. The figure below presents a higher-level
overview of neurally bootstrapped Bayesian inference.

## Getting Started: Parameter Estimation

The core functionality of BayesFlow is amortized Bayesian posterior estimation, as described in our paper:

Radev, S. T., Mertens, U. K., Voss, A., Ardizzone, L., & Köthe, U. (2020).
BayesFlow: Learning complex stochastic models with invertible neural networks.
<em>IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems</em>, available
for free at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06281.

However, since then, we have substantially extended the BayesFlow library such that
it is now much more general and cleaner than what we describe in the above paper.

### Minimal Example

```python
import numpy as np
import bayesflow as bf
```

To introduce you to the basic workflow of the library, let's consider
a simple 2D Gaussian model, from which we want to obtain
posterior inference.  We assume a Gaussian simulator (likelihood)
and a Gaussian prior for the means of the two components,
which are our only model parameters in this example:

```python
def simulator(theta, n_obs=50, scale=1.0):
    return np.random.default_rng().normal(loc=theta, scale=scale, size=(n_obs, theta.shape[0]))

def prior(D=2, mu=0., sigma=1.0):
    return np.random.default_rng().normal(loc=mu, scale=sigma, size=D)
```

Then, we connect the `prior` with the `simulator` using a `GenerativeModel` wrapper:

```python
generative_model = bf.simulation.GenerativeModel(prior, simulator, simulator_is_batched=False)
```

Next, we create our BayesFlow setup consisting of a summary and an inference network:

```python
summary_net = bf.networks.SetTransformer(input_dim=2)
inference_net = bf.networks.InvertibleNetwork(num_params=2)
amortized_posterior = bf.amortizers.AmortizedPosterior(inference_net, summary_net)
```

Finally, we connect the networks with the generative model via a `Trainer` instance:

```python
trainer = bf.trainers.Trainer(amortizer=amortized_posterior, generative_model=generative_model)
```

We are now ready to train an amortized posterior approximator. For instance,
to run online training, we simply call:

```python
losses = trainer.train_online(epochs=10, iterations_per_epoch=1000, batch_size=32)
```

Prior to inference, we can use simulation-based calibration (SBC,
https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06788) to check the computational faithfulness of
the model-amortizer combination on unseen simulations:

```python
# Generate 500 new simulated data sets
new_sims = trainer.configurator(generative_model(500))

# Obtain 100 posterior draws per data set instantly
posterior_draws = amortized_posterior.sample(new_sims, n_samples=100)

# Diagnose calibration
fig = bf.diagnostics.plot_sbc_histograms(posterior_draws, new_sims['parameters'])
```

<img src="https://github.com/stefanradev93/BayesFlow/blob/master/img/showcase_sbc.png?raw=true" width=65% height=65%>

The histograms are roughly uniform and lie within the expected range for
well-calibrated inference algorithms as indicated by the shaded gray areas.
Accordingly, our neural approximator seems to have converged to the intended target.

As you can see, amortized inference on new (real or simulated) data is easy and fast.
We can obtain further 5000 posterior draws per simulated data set and quickly inspect
how well the model can recover its parameters across the entire *prior predictive distribution*.


```python
posterior_draws = amortized_posterior.sample(new_sims, n_samples=5000)
fig = bf.diagnostics.plot_recovery(posterior_draws, new_sims['parameters'])
```

<img src="https://github.com/stefanradev93/BayesFlow/blob/master/img/showcase_recovery.png?raw=true" width=65% height=65%>

For any individual data set, we can also compare the parameters' posteriors with
their corresponding priors:

```python
fig = bf.diagnostics.plot_posterior_2d(posterior_draws[0], prior=generative_model.prior)
```

<img src="https://github.com/stefanradev93/BayesFlow/blob/master/img/showcase_posterior.png?raw=true" width=45% height=45%>

We see clearly how the posterior shrinks relative to the prior for both
model parameters as a result of conditioning on the data.

## Model Misspecification

What if we are dealing with misspecified models? That is, how faithful is our
amortized inference if the generative model is a poor representation of reality?
A modified loss function optimizes the learned summary statistics towards a unit
Gaussian and reliably detects model misspecification during inference time.


<img src="https://github.com/stefanradev93/BayesFlow/blob/master/examples/img/model_misspecification_amortized_sbi.png?raw=true" width=100% height=100%>

In order to use this method, you should only provide the `summary_loss_fun` argument
to the `AmortizedPosterior` instance:

```python
amortized_posterior = bf.amortizers.AmortizedPosterior(inference_net, summary_net, summary_loss_fun='MMD')
```

The amortizer knows how to combine its losses and you can inspect the summary space for outliers during inference.

## Model Comparison

BayesFlow can not only be used for parameter estimation, but also to perform approximate Bayesian model comparison via posterior model probabilities or Bayes factors.
Let's extend the minimal example from before with a second model $M_2$ that we want to compare with our original model $M_1$:

```python
def simulator(theta, n_obs=50, scale=1.0):
    return np.random.default_rng().normal(loc=theta, scale=scale, size=(n_obs, theta.shape[0]))

def prior_m1(D=2, mu=0., sigma=1.0):
    return np.random.default_rng().normal(loc=mu, scale=sigma, size=D)

def prior_m2(D=2, mu=2., sigma=1.0):
    return np.random.default_rng().normal(loc=mu, scale=sigma, size=D)
```

For the purpose of this illustration, the two toy models only differ with respect to their prior specification ($M_1: \mu = 0, M_2: \mu = 2$). We create both models as before and use a `MultiGenerativeModel` wrapper to combine them in a `meta_model`:

```python
model_m1 = bf.simulation.GenerativeModel(prior_m1, simulator, simulator_is_batched=False)
model_m2 = bf.simulation.GenerativeModel(prior_m2, simulator, simulator_is_batched=False)
meta_model = bf.simulation.MultiGenerativeModel([model_m1, model_m2])
```

Next, we construct our neural network with a `PMPNetwork` for approximating posterior model probabilities:

```python
summary_net = bf.networks.SetTransformer(input_dim=2)
probability_net = bf.networks.PMPNetwork(num_models=2)
amortized_bmc = bf.amortizers.AmortizedModelComparison(probability_net, summary_net)
```

We combine all previous steps with a `Trainer` instance and train the neural approximator:

```python
trainer = bf.trainers.Trainer(amortizer=amortized_bmc, generative_model=meta_model)
losses = trainer.train_online(epochs=3, iterations_per_epoch=100, batch_size=32)
```

Let's simulate data sets from our models to check our networks' performance:

```python
sims = trainer.configurator(meta_model(5000))
```

When feeding the data to our trained network, we almost immediately obtain posterior model probabilities for each of the 5000 data sets:

```python
model_probs = amortized_bmc.posterior_probs(sims)
```

How good are these predicted probabilities in the closed world? We can have a look at the calibration:

```python
cal_curves = bf.diagnostics.plot_calibration_curves(sims["model_indices"], model_probs)
```

<img src="https://github.com/stefanradev93/BayesFlow/blob/master/img/showcase_calibration_curves.png?raw=true" width=65% height=65%>

Our approximator shows excellent calibration, with the calibration curve being closely aligned to the diagonal, an expected calibration error (ECE) near 0 and most predicted probabilities being certain of the model underlying a data set. We can further assess patterns of misclassification with a confusion matrix:

```python
conf_matrix = bf.diagnostics.plot_confusion_matrix(sims["model_indices"], model_probs)
```

<img src="https://github.com/stefanradev93/BayesFlow/blob/master/img/showcase_confusion_matrix.png?raw=true" width=44% height=44%>

For the vast majority of simulated data sets, the "true" data-generating model is correctly identified. With these diagnostic results backing us up, we can proceed and apply our trained network to empirical data.

BayesFlow is also able to conduct model comparison for hierarchical models. See this [tutorial notebook](examples/Hierarchical_Model_Comparison_MPT.ipynb) for an introduction to the associated workflow.

## Likelihood Emulation

In order to learn the exchangeable (i.e., permutation invariant) likelihood from the minimal example instead of the posterior, you may use the `AmortizedLikelihood` wrapper:

```python
likelihood_net = bf.networks.InvertibleNetwork(num_params=2)
amortized_likelihood = bf.amortizers.AmortizedLikelihood(likelihood_net)
```

This wrapper can interact with a `Trainer` instance in the same way as the `AmortizedPosterior`. Finally, you can also learn the likelihood and the posterior *simultaneously* by using the `AmortizedPosteriorLikelihood` wrapper and choosing your preferred training scheme:

```python
joint_amortizer = bf.amortizers.AmortizedPosteriorLikelihood(amortized_posterior, amortized_likelihood)
```

Learning both densities enables us to approximate marginal likelihoods or perform approximate leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) for prior or posterior predictive model comparison, respectively.
